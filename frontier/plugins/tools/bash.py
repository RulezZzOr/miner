    non-empty, and a Python ``MemoryError`` prints nothing to stdout — so the

    Two guards against telling a successful command it ran out of memory, which
    would be worse than saying nothing — the model would "fix" working code:

    * A zero exit is never a memory failure, whatever the text says. ``grep
      MemoryError app.log`` succeeds and prints the marker; so does ``cat`` of a
      traceback someone committed.
    * Markers are matched against stderr only. A memory failure reports itself
      there; stdout is data the command chose to print. Exit codes are still
      authoritative on their own, since a SIGKILLed process prints nothing.

    Precedence, highest first:

    1. ``BASH_TIMEOUT`` in the environment — an explicit operator override,

       still takes effect and tests can set it.
    2. The agent loop's configured budget for this tool call, i.e. the
       profile's ``tool_timeout_s``.
    3. :data:`_DEFAULT_BASH_TIMEOUT`, for calls made outside the loop.

    The loop budget is a CEILING on (1): ``execute_tools`` cancels the call at
    the budget plus its own grace, so a larger override would only replace the
    structured timeout message below with a bare "tool timed out" — the model
    would lose the recovery hint and still lose the command. It is clamped, and
    the clamp is logged once so a misconfiguration is visible without spamming
    a long run.

    This function is why ``tool_timeout_s`` reaches bash at all: the deadline
    used to be a module constant frozen at import, so a profile asking for 1800s
    still got 300s and every long compile/simulation died at 5 minutes (#53).

    """Execute a bash command in an isolated E2B or bubblewrap sandbox.

    Use this for: Python code execution (with any packages like matplotlib,
    numpy, pandas), shell commands, file operations, and computation.

    To run Python, pipe a script to ``python3`` via a heredoc — this is the
    preferred way and avoids the quoting/escaping pain of ``python3 -c`` while
    supporting full multi-line scripts:

        python3 <<'PY'
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv("/inputs/data.csv")
        print(df.describe())
        PY

    Reserve ``python3 -c "..."`` for trivial one-liners.

    Args:
        command: The bash command to execute. For Python, prefer a
            ``python3 <<'PY' ... PY`` heredoc (multi-line) over ``python3 -c``.
        description: Optional description of what this command does (for logging).

    Each command runs with a per-process memory limit (1 GB by default; see
    SANDBOX_CONTAINER_MEM_MB). Processing a large dataset by loading it whole
    will hit it — read in chunks or stream instead. Hitting the limit raises
    MemoryError in the command, not an infrastructure failure.

    Genuinely long jobs (compiles, simulations, training runs) are fine to run
    in one call — the per-command deadline is the session's configured tool
    timeout, not a few minutes. Do not pre-emptively split work into chunks to
    stay under a guessed limit. If a job may exceed the deadline, launch it with
    nohup, redirect its output to a file, and poll that file on later calls; the
    timeout message says so too if you hit it. This requires a runtime that
    supports persistent jobs; native Studio mission calls are one-shot and
    must finish and clean up their own temporary service within the call.
