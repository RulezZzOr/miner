    """Create or edit a deliverable file in the sandbox — office (docx/xlsx/pptx)
    OR text (txt/md/csv/tsv/json/jsonl/html/htm).

    This is THE tool for producing EVERY deliverable file — .docx / .xlsx /
    .pptx (plus PDF via export_pdf), AND text files .txt / .md / .csv / .tsv /
    .json / .jsonl / .html / .htm. Author every deliverable through it. The ONLY case
    where you may fall back to Python libraries (python-docx / openpyxl /
    python-pptx / reportlab) or bash is when a create_file call has EXPLICITLY
    returned an unsupported-operation/extension error for what the task requires
    — try create_file first; do not decide on your own that a feature is
    unsupported. The fallback order is strict: first create_file; then Python
    libraries; only then, when Python still cannot cover the operation or the
    user requires accurate preservation of an existing template that Python
    would not preserve, use the runtime-advertised `docx` or `pptxgenjs`
    packages through bash. `NODE_PATH` is already configured, so load them by
    package name instead of a hard-coded install path. Never hand-build
    deliverables with bash (echo / cat / heredoc / redirection); a csv/md/txt
    deliverable goes through create_file, NOT a shell redirect. For a whole text
    file in one shot pass `content` (or `rows` / `data`) directly and leave `ops`
    out: create_file(path="/outputs/report.md", content="# Title\n..."). Write scratch to /workspace and ONLY the final
    deliverable(s) to /outputs, kept clean (no scratch or duplicate versions).

    Pass `ops`, a JSON array where EACH item is a single-key object {op_name:
    {params}}, applied IN ORDER to the same file (do MANY operations in ONE call):
      ops=[{"create":{"sheets":[...]}},
           {"set_cell":{"sheet":"S","cell":"B2","value":42,"type":"number"}},
           {"set_cell_format":{"sheet":"S","cell_range":"A1:C1","bold":true}}]
    Run set_cell 50 times = 50 items in ONE call (not 50 calls). One sandbox call
    runs them sequentially; if an op errors, execution STOPS there and the result
    lists what ran. Each item must have EXACTLY ONE key (the op name). For a large
    program, write the JSON array to a /workspace file and pass
    ops="@/workspace/program.json".

    PATHS — only two directories are writable and persistent in the sandbox:
      • /workspace  — your private scratch dir; intermediate files + the ops JSON.
      • /outputs    — final deliverables ONLY (this is what gets collected/graded).
        Exception: /outputs/scratch/ persists across rounds — put intermediate
        products worth reusing in a later round there. NOT a deliverable, never
        shown to the user; 512MB quota (over-quota writes error until you delete
        files there). Only the literal top-level /outputs/scratch/ counts.
      Any other location (e.g. /home/..., /tmp/...) is NOT mounted: writes/reads
      there FAIL or do not persist across calls. So `path` (and any ops "@file")
      must be under /workspace or /outputs — write the final deliverable to /outputs.

    Incremental load-modify-save (existing files are edited in place, untouched
    parts preserved). Anchors use STABLE references: xlsx by sheet name + A1
    cell/range; pptx by 1-based slide number + placeholder role; docx by anchor
    TEXT (find / after_text) — never fragile positional indices.

    CREATE is for a NEW file. Calling `create` on a path that ALREADY exists is
    REFUSED (so you never silently wipe prior content) — to add to an existing
    file use insert_*/set_cell/add_slide/replace_text; pass {"overwrite":true}
    only if you truly mean to rebuild from scratch.

    XLSX FORMULAS — write Excel FORMULAS, do NOT compute values in your head and
    hardcode the number: use {"set_cell":{...,"value":"=SUM(B2:B9)","type":"formula"}}
    (or value starting with "="), NOT the literal sum. Formula caches are EMPTY
    until recalculated; create_file auto-runs LibreOffice recalc on save whenever the
    batch wrote any formula, fills the cached values, and reports any formula
    errors (#DIV/0!, #REF!, ...) back in the result so you can fix them.

    TEXT IS LITERAL — formatting goes through structured params, NEVER Markdown.
    Any "text" field accepts RichText: a plain string, OR a list of runs for
    inline formatting / links:
      [{"text":"Total ","bold":true}, {"text":"site","link":"https://x.com"}]
    Run fields (all optional except text): bold, italic, underline, strike,
    color("RRGGBB"), size(pt), font, link(url). Do NOT write "**bold**",
    "[t](url)", "- item" or "# h" in text — they are written verbatim; use the
    params below instead.

    FONTS — the deliverable is downloaded and opened on an unknown platform, so
    name only fonts that exist almost everywhere; anything else is silently
    substituted (different glyphs, different widths, shifted line/page breaks):
      Latin      : Arial / Times New Roman / Courier New / Calibri / Cambria
      Chinese    : SimSun (宋体, serif) / SimHei (黑体) / Microsoft YaHei (微软雅黑, sans)
      Japanese   : MS Gothic / MS Mincho / Meiryo / Yu Gothic
      Korean     : Malgun Gothic / Batang
    Use a font outside this list ONLY WHEN the task explicitly asks for it —
    Linux-only families in particular (Noto Sans CJK *, Source Han *, DejaVu *,
    Liberation *) are absent on stock Windows/macOS, so a reader always gets a
    substitution. When the text contains Chinese/Japanese/Korean, name a CJK
    family from the list above (`font` applies to the CJK characters too); a
    Latin-only font leaves CJK to whatever the reader's app falls back to.
    Fewer fonts = fewer surprises: prefer one family per document.

    Args:
        path: Absolute path of the file to write — under /outputs for a final
            deliverable, or /workspace for an intermediate file. Not other dirs.
        ops: JSON array of operations; each item is a single-key object
            {op_name: {params}}, applied in order. May be a JSON array string, or
            "@/workspace/program.json" pointing to such an array. Omit it when
            you are using the content/rows/data shorthand below.
        content: Shorthand for a text file written in one shot — the literal
            file body. Equivalent to ops=[{"create": {"content": ...}}]. Text
            formats including source code (py/js/ts/css), configuration and
            extensionless files (Dockerfile/Makefile). This writes text; it does not execute it.
        rows: Shorthand alternative to `content`: an array of csv/tsv rows, or
            of jsonl objects.
        data: Shorthand alternative to `content`: a JSON object/array to
            serialise into the file.
        overwrite: Allow the shorthand to rebuild a file that already exists.
            Without it an existing path is refused, so you never silently wipe
            prior content.

    Returns:
        A per-op result summary, or an error/hint message.
